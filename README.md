# Perceptron Learning Algorithm: Implementation & Analysis

This project explores the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) for binary classification, applied to the Banknote Authentication Dataset. Implemented from scratch without using external machine learning libraries like sklearn, ensuring a deeper understanding of its working principles.

Key Components:
* Data preprocessing – Formatting class labels, handling feature scaling, and ensuring dataset integrity
* Perceptron model implementation – Training the model with iterative weight updates to classify banknotes
* Performance evaluation – Measuring accuracy and analyzing decision boundaries

This project demonstrates how the Perceptron Algorithm can be used in real-world classification problems, providing insights into its strengths and limitations.
